## Use Cases

##Introduction

Uses narrative text and a ‘storyboard’ concept to depict and describe a set of possible sequences of interactions between systems and users in ICAM environment. Core components include:

* Narrative paragraph – Describes the use case at a high level and provides other relevant context.
* Storyboards – A set of panels that depict the steps required to achieve the end goal of the use case. Some use cases, such as Create and Maintain an Identity, have branching steps.
* Precondition and Postcondition – The conditions that should be in place before the use case begins, and the result of use case completion, respectively.
* Actors & Systems Key – Shows the individuals and systems involved in the use case. Actors common to multiple use cases are depicted using the same symbol.
* Area and Service Mapping – A symbol (located in the bottom right) that shows the high-level area (Identity, Credential, Access, or Federation) and the Service that the use case most generally applies to.

##Audience
ICAM Enterprise Architecture; Business line and/or unit managers

##Purpose
To depict the most common sequence of steps used to deliver a business outcome, using government-wide best practices and applicable standards.

##Background & Key Revisions
* Emphasis on graphics: Replaced long narrative descriptions with abstract graphical depictions to make use cases easier to read and understand.
* Focus on target state: Removed descriptions of current state processes, instead focusing on the target-state environment.
* Revised scope: Removed use cases that were out of scope, combined ones with similar concepts, and added or expanded to cover gaps, including federation, common access models, and process differences related to LOA.
