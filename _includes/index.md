## Introduction
The FICAM Architecture, created in 2009, was developed to provide a common segment architecture for use by federal agencies. Federal government policies and guidance continue to recognize the importance of the FICAM Architecture in supporting implementation efforts and program maturity. Ultimately, the FICAM Architecture has served, and will continue to serve, as a tool for providing awareness to ICAM Programs and external mission and business partners to drive a common understanding of ICAM and the successful implementation of interoperable and cost efficient solutions. The following pages are a result of efforts to update the FICAM Architecture to reflect ongoing changes in both ICAM environments and government-wide priorities.

The guides and configuration tutorials on these pages are to help you understand and use the FICAM Architecture.
