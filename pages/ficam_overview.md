title: FICAM Architecture Overview

The FICAM Architecture outlines a common framework for ICAM within the Federal government. The Common Approach to Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) outlines six sub-architecture domains that normalize the way activities are described and delineate the types of elements that should be created when developing an enterprise architecture. The FICAM Architecture attempts to provide a government-wide view of ICAM for enterprise-level use. To that end, specific artifacts have been identified and developed to support this use where they may provide the most usefulness to an agency. Many of these elements are conceptual in nature and each element should first and foremost be recognized as a tool, not a standard or requirement, to support agency ICAM implementation. Below is an outline of the FICAM Architecture elements and their alignment to the FEA layers:

To support a collaborative environment for the Federal ICAM Community and its partners, and to enable a more agile design of these artifacts and tools, the working versions of each artifact have been released on this site for continuous refinement and improvement.   
Stakeholders and partners are urged to continuously review these tools and provide recommendations on how they can be improved to support agency knowledge and ICAM implementation. Source files, final records, and future revisions will be managed by the FICAM Program, with guidance and support from the CIO Councilâ€™s ICAMSC.
