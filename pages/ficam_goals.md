##Considerations

##Background & Key Revisions

- Relevance to ICAM: Ensured all language clearly conveys not just a general cybersecurity goal but how ICAM contributes to that goal’s success.

- Goals vs. Objectives: Revised language so ICAM Goals accomplish high level aspirations of the Federal Government, whereas Objectives discuss actionable ways to achieve those goals.

- Removed ‘compliance’-focused goal which stated that FICAM will comply with relevant regulations, in favor of showing throughout the document how ICAM inherently contributes to Federal compliance.
