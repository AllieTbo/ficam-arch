When an individual requests access to a resource at an outside organization, that organization usually needs the individual’s attributes to make an access decision. Rather than creating a new identity record, the organization can query a metadata service to determine where a record of that individual’s attributes already exists. This can also be used to support design time identity maintenance.
This use case demonstrates both a brokered (a) and non-brokered (b) approach for obtaining attributes. It also applies to applies to situations where attributes are being sought from another division within the same organization.
