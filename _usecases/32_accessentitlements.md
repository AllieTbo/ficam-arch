Entitlements management is the process of overseeing and adjusting the access privileges granted to individuals, roles, and groups within an organization. This process is sometimes known as ‘provisioning’ and applies mainly to the “static” model of access management (see Authorize Access, Static). 
Managing entitlements happens during design time, before an individual attempts to access protected resources, and an individual’s entitlements must be provisioned before they will be able to access protected resources.
