This use case describes, in detail, the steps for authenticating a user who has requested access to a protected resource. It stems from the ‘Grant access to a protected resource’ use case and expands on Step 3, ‘Verify authentication factors.’
Authentication is the process by which a system verifies the user’s claimed identity to a certain level of assurance (LOA).  LOA1 is the lowest level, and LOA4 is the highest.
There are three types of authentication factors: something you know (such as a password or PIN), something you have (such as a smartcard), and something you are (such as your fingerprint). At LOA3 and LOA4, at least two types of factors are required.
