title: Create and Issue Level of Assurance 4 Credential
collection: usecases
---
This use case describes the process for creating and issuing a credential at Level of Assurance 4 (LOA4).  
A credential token meets LOA4 when it uses multiple factors for authentication (see Authentication Use Case), includes regular online checks that the credential is still valid, and includes a strong cryptographic module.  
LOA4 tokens are exclusively hardware-based and are recognized as LOA4 strength only when paired with identity proofing at LOA4.
