title: Authorize Access - Static
collection: usecases
---
This use case provides, in detail, the steps for the static method of authorizing access to a protected resource. It stems from the ‘Grant access to a protected resource’ use case and expands on Step 4, ‘Authorization Check.’
Under the static model, an organization provisions users to a set of access entitlements.  Whenever they attempt to access a protected resource, the access control system (ACS) checks their permissions against the resource’s access rules. 
This model is typical of Access Control Lists (ACL) and RBAC (role-based access control) systems.
