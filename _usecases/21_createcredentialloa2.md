title: Create and Issue Level of Assurance 2 Credential
collection: usecases
---
This use case describes the process for creating and issuing a credential at Level of Assurance 2 (LOA2).
A credential token meets LOA2 when it uses a single factor for authentication (See Authentication use case), mandates a strong PIN or password, and only transmits credential information using cryptographic protection.
LOA2 credentials are usually software tokens and are recognized as LOA2 strength only when paired with identity proofing at LOA2, LOA3, or LOA4.
