title: Create and Issue Level of Assurance 3 Credential
collection: usecases
---
This use case describes the process for creating and issuing a credential at Level of Assurance 3 (LOA3).
A credential token meets LOA3 when it uses multiple factors for authentication (see Authentication Use Case), includes regular online checks that the credential is still valid, and includes strong cryptography.  
LOA3 credentials can be either hardware or software tokens and are recognized as LOA3 strength when paired with identity proofing at LOA3 or LOA4.
