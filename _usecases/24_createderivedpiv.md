When a federal employee or contractor requires PIV authentication but using their PIV card is not practical, using a derived PIV may be an option.
A derived PIV is a secure, reliable, federally issued credential issued to a mobile device, generally a smartphone or tablet, that allows an individual to use their mobile device in place of their PIV card. An individual must first have been issued a PIV card in order to be eligible for a derived PIV.
A derived PIV can be either LOA3 or LOA4. An LOA3 derived PIV uses either software or hardware to connect with a mobile device, whereas an LOA4 derived PIV must be a hardware token.
