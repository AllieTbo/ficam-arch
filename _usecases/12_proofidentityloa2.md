title: Proof an Identity at Level of Assurance 2
collection: usecases

## Introduction

This use case describes the process for completing identity proofing at Level of Assurance 2 (LOA2), which allows them to receive an LOA2 credential. LOA2 requires an individual submit basic documents to prove their claimed identity and may be completed in person or remotely.

## Considerations 

* Identity proofing at LOA2 mostly applies to citizens, or others, who are not Federal employees or contractors but require access to data on Federal systems. Citizens generally do not require the extensive identity proofing of LOA3 or LOA4, but the minimal identity proofing of LOA1 may not meet the standards needed to access certain government systems.

## Background & Key Revisions

* Identity proofing has been broken out by LOA because the process is very different at each level 
* The Federal Government should not conduct identity proofing at LOA1, so a use case for this level has been omitted. It was decided that these use cases should only show activities likely to be performed by government.
* At LOA2, identity proofing can be completed either in-person or remotely. These options have been depicted in this use case as two initial “branches” that lead to the same final step.
* The “approval authority” has not been further defined because that role likely will vary from agency to agency.
* The Precondition has been intentionally left vague because the circumstances under which a person would seek identity proofing at LOA2 will vary.
