title: Authorize Access - Dynamic
collection: usecases
---
This use case provides, in detail, the steps for the dynamic method of authorizing access to a protected resource. It stems from the ‘Grant access to a protected resource’ use case and expands on Step 4, ‘Authorization Check.’
Under the dynamic model, an organization establishes a set of access policies.  Whenever a user attempts to access a protected resource, the access control system (ACS) evaluates their attributes against those policies. When a user’s attributes change, their access entitlements change dynamically.
This model is typical of ABAC (attribute-based access control) systems.
